To achieve greater ‘user immersion’ and to make the user feel they are ‘actually there’ the design of immersive soundscapes (ambient, directional, Foley, reverberation zones etc.) and realistic lighting effects is taught. Also, the creation and control of NPCs (non-player characters), including using AI techniques to control their behaviour, is covered. Controlling the VR environment using computer code (C#) is introduced at an early stage as well as industry standard project management techniques (Agile, Scrum, GIT repositories) which the student uses throughout the course. Students will progress from creating simple ‘cartoon’ worlds to constructing much more realistic and immersive VR environments.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   These skills are further refined in three group projects:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   (i)\n   <strong>\n    An Emotion Machine\n   </strong>\n   (designed to induce emotion in the user e.g., the user experiences a physical disability or perhaps must confront a specific phobia).\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    <a href=\"https://online.flippingbook.com/view/376125175/\">\n     VIEW EXAMPLE: Arachnophobia VR - Group Assignment\n    </a>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   (ii)\n   <strong>\n    A Training Machine\n   </strong>\n   (a VR application is created to train the user in a certain task e.g., basic fire safety and evacuation training).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   (iii)\n   <strong>\n    An Information Machine\n   </strong>\n   (e.g., an AR or “Augmented Reality” application using a tablet computer which overlays virtual information and data on top of real machines and equipment and allows the user to interrogate and control the equipment wirelessly via the App).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Apart from the specialised VR development courses, other modules cover such themes as marketing, developing your own web presence and presentation/writing skills. This is to ensure that students are more than merely programmers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After all this the student should be well-prepared for their main individual project, which takes place over the summertime, when they work on a VR project with an external partner. During this final project (and during all the previous assignments) the teaching staff are available to provide help and guidance - and often a free debugging service!\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"title-and-body-text title-and-body-text-12\">\n  <h2>\n   Virtual Reality with Industry Employment Opportunities\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   It is hard to think of an area of human activity or interest which would not benefit from VR in some way. Numerous industries have already adopted VR practices and as a result are all future employers in this industry. At present, there is a real shortage of VR specialists, especially individuals with additional subject expertise e.g., engineering, science, business, and arts and humanities. This is hampering industry growth. Our aim is to satisfy this shortage by producing experts who are already qualified to degree level in one discipline but who also possess the highly desirable skill of creating their own original VR applications.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/media/Joe-Charman-case-study-graphic-500x500.jpg\"/>\n   <img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/media/Jack-Bengeyfield-case-study-graphic-500x500.jpg\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Potential Graduate Destinations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Some students have gained employment immediately after the course.

The field is quickly growing due to the ever-increasing complexity of the problems faced by industry and society. These problems include the need to mitigate the climate change, the need to engineer new materials and to optimise components, systems, and processes, just to name a few.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Addressing these challenges is only possible by using computational engineering to complement experimental work. Computational tools also provide a unique avenue for companies to reduce the time-to-market and time-to-manufacture of their products. In the current digital era, the use of big data and machine learning to constantly update the models has also opened the door to the development of digital twins in many areas of Engineering and Science.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The MSc Computational Engineering will equip students with the necessary skills to develop computational tools for the challenges of the 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   century.\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"title-and-body-text title-and-body-text-12\">\n  <h2>\n   Computational Engineering with Industry Employment Opportunities\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   Graduates of the MSc Computational Engineering have a wide range of opportunities. They can access jobs in industry or academia, depending on their interests.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Due to the unique skills of a Computational Engineer, the expected salary is usually higher than a standard Engineer. For instance, in the UK, the average salary of a Computational Engineering job in November 2022 is £43K, whereas the average salary of an Engineering job is £38K. It is worth noting that employers seeking for graduates use either “Computational Engineer”, “Modelling Engineer” or “Simulation Engineer” in their descriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Companies that offer jobs to Computational Engineers include some of the most famous brands worldwide, namely Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Boeing, Chevron, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, General Dynamics, HP, IBM, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Nike, Pfizer, Tesla.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After graduation, some students prefer to pursue a PhD in Computational Engineering.

To achieve greater ‘user immersion’ and to make the user feel they are ‘actually there’ the design of immersive soundscapes (ambient, directional, Foley, reverberation zones etc.) and realistic lighting effects is taught. Also, the creation and control of NPCs (non-player characters), including using AI techniques to control their behaviour, is covered. Controlling the VR environment using computer code (C#) is introduced at an early stage as well as industry standard project management techniques (Agile, Scrum, GIT repositories) which the student uses throughout the course. Students will progress from creating simple ‘cartoon’ worlds to constructing much more realistic and immersive VR environments.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   These skills are further refined in three group projects:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   (i)\n   <strong>\n    An Emotion Machine\n   </strong>\n   (designed to induce emotion in the user e.g., the user experiences a physical disability or perhaps must confront a specific phobia).\n   <br/>\n   <strong>\n    <a href=\"https://online.flippingbook.com/view/376125175/\">\n     VIEW EXAMPLE: Arachnophobia VR - Group Assignment\n    </a>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   (ii)\n   <strong>\n    A Training Machine\n   </strong>\n   (a VR application is created to train the user in a certain task e.g., basic fire safety and evacuation training).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   (iii)\n   <strong>\n    An Information Machine\n   </strong>\n   (e.g., an AR or “Augmented Reality” application using a tablet computer which overlays virtual information and data on top of real machines and equipment and allows the user to interrogate and control the equipment wirelessly via the App).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Apart from the specialised VR development courses, other modules cover such themes as marketing, developing your own web presence and presentation/writing skills. This is to ensure that students are more than merely programmers.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After all this the student should be well-prepared for their main individual project, which takes place over the summertime, when they work on a VR project with an external partner. During this final project (and during all the previous assignments) the teaching staff are available to provide help and guidance - and often a free debugging service!\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"title-and-body-text title-and-body-text-12\">\n  <h2>\n   Virtual Reality Employment Opportunities\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   It is hard to think of an area of human activity or interest which would not benefit from VR in some way. Numerous industries have already adopted VR practices and as a result are all future employers in this industry. At present, there is a real shortage of VR specialists, especially individuals with additional subject expertise e.g., engineering, science, business, and arts and humanities. This is hampering industry growth. Our aim is to satisfy this shortage by producing experts who are already qualified to degree level in one discipline but who also possess the highly desirable skill of creating their own original VR applications.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/media/Joe-Charman-case-study-graphic-500x500.jpg\"/>\n   <img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/media/Jack-Bengeyfield-case-study-graphic-500x500.jpg\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    Potential Graduate Destinations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Some students have gained employment immediately after the course.

The School is wholly committed to continuous improvement in learning and teaching, and to putting students at the centre of its activities. You will be supervised by academics and qualified practitioners with a wealth of real-world experience, who are ideally placed to provide ongoing guidance and support.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <strong>\n    The Solicitors Qualifying Examination (SQE)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The introduction of the SQE from September 2021 marked a significant change in the route to qualification as a solicitor in England and Wales.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The SQE, which involves two stages of centrally assessed examinations (SQE1 and SQE2) and a period of qualifying work experience, aims to provide a fair and consistent assessment for all candidates.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The SQE will eventually replace the current routes into practice.

Understanding the modern world demands a full appreciation of conflict and violence.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   This course explores coverage of ‘traditional’ security issues such as war and conflict, in addition to ‘non-traditional’ issues such as economic security, environmental security, health and migration.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You will receive an advanced introduction to the main approaches in the study of security. These approaches cover realism, securitization theory, feminist approaches, critical theory and poststructuralism.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The Extended MA (EMA) is a 240-credit postgraduate qualification that is equivalent to 120 ECTS (European Credit Transfer System) and is thus a recognised Masters qualification throughout the European Union. The EMA is a standard UK MA plus an additional 60 credits (30 ECTS) and this additional coursework is undertaken in one semester at a partner institution overseas. The EMA is therefore not only an EU recognised postgraduate qualification, it also adds a study abroad experience thus enhancing the qualification’s employability credentials.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The partner institution for EMA International Security and Development is the Department of International and Area Studies at The University of Oklahoma. The Department of International and Area Studies is an exciting and rapidly growing academic unit within the University of Oklahoma. It has approximately twenty faculty members and, critically for this EMA, their expertise lie within the fields of security and development. Created in 1890 The University of Oklahoma enrols more than 30,000 students, it has achieved the Carnegie Foundation’s highest tier of research activity classification, and is ranked in the top 400 universities in the world according to the Times Higher Education rankings.\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"title-and-body-text title-and-body-text-12\">\n  <h2>\n   Why International Security and Development (Extended) at Swansea?\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   Swansea University has a well respected name for the teaching of international security and development.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Based on our energising Singleton Park campus, in parkland overlooking Swansea Bay, we have the expertise and full range of modern facilities to ensure your learning is right up to the minute.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   The Graduate Centre is designed to promote individual and collaborative research activity of international standard.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   It offers a supportive environment for postgraduate research and taught masters study, as well as training to enhance academic and professional development.\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"title-and-body-text title-and-body-text-12\">\n  <h2>\n   Your International Security and Development (Extended) Experience\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   You will study four compulsory 20-credit international relations modules, and a further two optional modules before taking a 60-credit dissertation project of your choosing in the second part of the course.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   The compulsory modules are: human rights, humanitarian Intervention and global justice; critical security studies; and violence, conflict and development.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   A wide selection of optional modules span from war, technology and culture to the policy making process, and from rethinking global governance to democracy and constitutional design.\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"title-and-body-text title-and-body-text-12\">\n  <h2>\n   International Security and Development (Extended) Employment Opportunities\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   You will develop a depth of knowledge around international security and development, as well as excellent oral and writing skills.\n   <br/>\n   <br/>\n   Graduates of the MA in International Security and Development go on to have careers in UN organisations, government and politics, humanitarian organisations, media and PR.\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>\n", "application_dates": [{"value": "18 September 2024"}, {"value": "17 July 2024"}, {"value": "18 December 2024"}, {"value": "30 October 2024"}], "start_dates": [{"value": "Sep 2024"}], "entry_requirements": "<div class=\"expander-item is-collapsed\" id=\"entry-requirements\">\n <h3 class=\"expander-click-target\">\n  <a aria-controls=\"entry-requirements-contents\" aria-expanded=\"false\" href=\"#entry-requirements-contents\" role=\"button\">\n   Entry Requirements\n  </a>\n </h3>\n <div class=\"expander-contents\" id=\"entry-requirements-contents\">\n  <p>\n   The Department of Politics, Philosophy and International Relations offers a portfolio of five taught postgraduate programmes leading to a Master of Arts (MA) degree based on one year of study (on a full-time basis).

Since then, Swansea University has maintained a privileged international position in the field of Computational Mechanics.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In 1976 Prof Eugenio Oñate came to Swansea to do the MSc and PhD thesis under the supervision of Prof OC Zienkiewicz. After that, he returned to Barcelona where he founded the\n   <strong>\n    International Centre for Numerical Methods\n   </strong>\n   (CIMNE), which is still today one of the most important centres on numerical methods worldwide. The strong connection between Barcelona and Swansea led to Prof OC Zienkiewicz being appointed as UNESCO chair of numerical methods in Engineering at Barcelona. Since then, the collaboration between Swansea and Barcelona has grown and resulted in more than 70 publications have been jointly produced between academics from Swansea University and UPC in the last two decades.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The MSc in Computational Engineering with Industry is advised by an Industrial Steering Committee with industrial experts on computational engineering.

The field is quickly growing due to the ever-increasing complexity of the problems faced by industry and society. These problems include the need to mitigate the climate change, the need to engineer new materials and to optimise components, systems, and processes, just to name a few.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Addressing these challenges is only possible by using computational engineering to complement experimental work. Computational tools also provide a unique avenue for companies to reduce the time-to-market and time-to-manufacture of their products. In the current digital era, the use of big data and machine learning to constantly update the models has also opened the door to the development of digital twins in many areas of Engineering and Science.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The MSc Computational Engineering will equip students with the necessary skills to develop computational tools for the challenges of the 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   century.\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"title-and-body-text title-and-body-text-12\">\n  <h2>\n   Computational Mechanics Employment Opportunities\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   Graduates of the MSc Computational Engineering have a wide range of opportunities. They can access jobs in industry or academia, depending on their interests.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Due to the unique skills of a Computational Engineer, the expected salary is usually higher than a standard Engineer. For instance, in the UK, the average salary of a Computational Engineering job in November 2022 is £43K, whereas the average salary of an Engineering job is £38K. It is worth noting that employers seeking for graduates use either “Computational Engineer”, “Modelling Engineer” or “Simulation Engineer” in their descriptions.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Companies that offer jobs to Computational Engineers include some of the most famous brands worldwide, namely Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Boeing, Chevron, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, General Dynamics, HP, IBM, Intel, Meta, Microsoft, Nike, Pfizer, Tesla.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   After graduation, some students prefer to pursue a PhD in Computational Engineering.

Professor Zienkiewicz is internationally recognised as the \"Father of the Finite Element Method\" and founded the International Journal of Numerical Methods in Engineering and the UK Association for Computational Mechanics. Since then, Swansea University has maintained a privileged international position in the field of Computational Engineering.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The MSc in Computational Engineering is advised by an Industrial Steering Committee with industrial experts on computational engineering. The\n   <strong>\n    Industrial Steering Committee\n   </strong>\n   includes:\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <img alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/media/MicrosoftTeams-image-(15).png\"/>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The MSc Computational Engineering is taught by\n   <strong>\n    world-leading academics\n   </strong>\n   from the Zienkiewicz Institute for Modelling, Data and AI at Swansea University. These academics have a broad experience in creating new numerical methods and delivering computational tools that have been adopted by industry, including Airbus, BAE Systems, Chevron, NASA, SEAT, Siemens, Volkswagen.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In addition, these academics have written famous books in the field of Computational Engineering, and they have important positions in national and international associations in the field.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Students of the MSc Computational Engineering will be able to choose the topic of their dissertation among a wide range of themes. Students will have free access to all the software required to undertake their studies, both at PCs within the University and at home. For their dissertation they will also have access to the high-performance computing facilities available at Swansea, including the\n   <strong>\n    Impact Cluster and the Supercomputing Wales facilities\n   </strong>\n   at Swansea, with a total of 4,920 cores and 47 Tb of RAM memory.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Did you know?

The field is quickly growing due to the ever-increasing complexity of the problems faced by industry and society. These problems include the need to mitigate the climate change, the need to engineer new materials and to optimise components, systems, and processes, just to name a few.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Addressing these challenges is only possible by using computational engineering to complement experimental work. Computational tools also provide a unique avenue for companies to reduce the time-to-market and time-to-manufacture of their products. In the current digital era, the use of big data and machine learning to constantly update the models has also opened the door to the development of digital twins in many areas of Engineering and Science.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The MSc Computational Engineering will equip students with the necessary skills to develop computational tools for the challenges of the 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   century.\n  </p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"title-and-body-text title-and-body-text-12\">\n  <h2>\n   Computational Engineering Employment Opportunities\n  </h2>\n  <p>\n   Graduates of the MSc Computational Engineering have a wide range of opportunities. They can access jobs in industry or academia, depending on their interests.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Due to the unique skills of a Computational Engineer, the expected salary is usually higher than a standard Engineer. For instance, in the UK, the average salary of a Computational Engineering job in November 2022 is £43K, whereas the average salary of an Engineering job is £38K.

The part-time MBA follows the exact same syllabus at its full-time counterpart but is set across two years.\n  </p>\n  <h3>\n   Download our\n   <a
